# This repository is used to define coding styles for languages used by IceShard projects.

Currently C++ is the most common one and mostly defined and can be seeon as 'final'. 
Additional changes to the style may introduce more specific rules but will avoid breaking changes.

You can find the style in this document: [C++ Style](./style_cxx.md)
