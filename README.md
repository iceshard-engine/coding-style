# IceShard conding guidelines

This repository is used to define coding guidelines for languages used by IceShard projects.

Currently C++ is the most common used language, and the only one with a defined guidelin.
More to come eventually.

## C++

This guideline can be seen as **final**.
* Additional changes to the style may introduce more specific rules but will avoid breaking changes.

You can find the guildine document here: [C++ guidelines](./style_cxx.md)
